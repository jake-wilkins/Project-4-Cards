I actually have no idea how this Github nonsense works, and it's not very easy to decipher. I'm working on translations/rotations currently, but this should render a scene where the camera is at -0.5 in the y, looking at the center of the table, resulting in an angled camera. All of the cards but one are drawn in the same spot, I'm aware. When the translations/rotations work, that won't happen.
